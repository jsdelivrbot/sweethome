# SWEETHOME

Home sweet home. Designed to be use with [homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick).

## VIM CONFIG

### Runtime configuration

 - When trailing spaces present they will appear marked red;
 - Tabs = 4 spaces;

 - Arrow keys are disabled;
 - Omni completion is mapped to ```Ctrl+Space```;
 - Line numbers and ruler are enabled;
 - Backspace will act as backspace.

### Vim modules

I use [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) for autoload modules and they are inside **./vim/bundle** folder. Because of **homesick** all modules are [git submodules](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules) and described in **.gitmodules** file.
